# Plan a new task

## Feature: $ARGUMENTS

## Mission

Transform a feature request into a **comprehensive implementation plan** through systematic codebase analysis, external research, and strategic planning. Review the PRD.md file and related Phase#.md file based on $ARGUMENTS.

**Core Principle**: We do NOT write code in this phase. Our goal is to create a context-rich implementation plan that enables one-pass implementation success for ai agents.

**Key Philosophy**: Context is King. The plan must contain ALL information needed for implementation - patterns, mandatory reading, documentation, validation commands - so the execution agent succeeds on the first attempt.

## Planning Process

### Phase 1: Feature Understanding

**Deep Feature Analysis:**

- Extract the core problem being solved
- Identify user value and business impact
- Determine feature type: New Capability/Enhancement/Refactor/Bug Fix
- Assess complexity: Low/Medium/High
- Map affected systems and components

**Create User Story Format Or Refine If Story Was Provided By The User:**

```
As a <type of user>
I want to <action/goal>
So that <benefit/value>
```

### Phase 2: Codebase Intelligence Gathering

**Use specialized agents and parallel analysis:**

**1. Project Structure Analysis**

- Detect primary language(s), frameworks, and runtime versions
- Map directory structure and architectural patterns
- Identify service/component boundaries and integration points
- Locate configuration files (pyproject.toml, package.json, etc.)
- Find environment setup and build processes

**2. Pattern Recognition** (Use specialized subagents when beneficial)

- Search for similar implementations in codebase
- Identify coding conventions:
  - Naming patterns (CamelCase, snake_case, kebab-case)
  - File organization and module structure
  - Error handling approaches
  - Logging patterns and standards
- Extract common patterns for the feature's domain
- Document anti-patterns to avoid
- Check CLAUDE.md for project-specific rules and conventions

**3. Dependency Analysis**

- Catalog external libraries relevant to feature
- Understand how libraries are integrated (check imports, configs)
- Find relevant documentation in docs/, ai_docs/, .agents/reference or ai-wiki if available
- Note library versions and compatibility requirements

**4. Verify git branch**

- Verify you are in an appropriate branch. Either Main or a branch appropriate to phase/feature being worked on.

  1 — Switch to main and sync with remote

  git checkout main
  git pull origin main

  2 — Verify you're up to date

  git log --oneline -5        # confirm latest commits look right
  git status                  # confirm clean working tree

  3 — Create and switch to a new branch

  git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name

  Following the branch naming from CLAUDE.md:
  - feat/ — new features (e.g., feat/langfuse-integration)
  - fix/ — bug fixes (e.g., fix/async-pool-cleanup)

  4 — Push the branch to GitHub (first time)

  git push -u origin feat/your-feature-name
  The -u sets the upstream so future git push / git pull on this branch need no extra args.


**4. Testing Patterns**

- Identify test framework and structure (pytest, jest, etc.)
- Find similar test examples for reference
- Understand test organization (unit vs integration)
- Note coverage requirements and testing standards

**5. Integration Points**

- Identify existing files that need updates
- Determine new files that need creation and their locations
- Map router/API registration patterns
- Understand database/model patterns if applicable
- Identify authentication/authorization patterns if relevant

**Clarify Ambiguities:**

- If requirements are unclear at this point, ask the user to clarify before you continue
- Get specific implementation preferences (libraries, approaches, patterns)
- Resolve architectural decisions before proceeding

### Phase 3: External Research & Documentation

**Use specialized subagents when beneficial for external research:**

**Documentation Gathering:**

- Research latest library versions and best practices
- Find official documentation with specific section anchors
- Locate implementation examples and tutorials
- Identify common gotchas and known issues
- Check for breaking changes and migration guides

**Technology Trends:**

- Research current best practices for the technology stack
- Find relevant blog posts, guides, or case studies
- Identify performance optimization patterns
- Document security considerations

**Compile Research References:**

```markdown
## Relevant Documentation

- [Library Official Docs](https://example.com/docs#section)
  - Specific feature implementation guide
  - Why: Needed for X functionality
- [Framework Guide](https://example.com/guide#integration)
  - Integration patterns section
  - Why: Shows how to connect components
```

### Phase 4: Deep Strategic Thinking

**Think Harder About:**

- How does this feature fit into the existing architecture?
- What are the critical dependencies and order of operations?
- What could go wrong? (Edge cases, race conditions, errors)
- How will this be tested comprehensively?
- What performance implications exist?
- Are there security considerations?
- How maintainable is this approach?

**Design Decisions:**

- Choose between alternative approaches with clear rationale
- Design for extensibility and future modifications
- Plan for backward compatibility if needed
- Consider scalability implications

**PRD Validation (if PRD exists):**
- Read PRD — check `.agents/PRD.md` first, then `docs/PRD.md` as fallback
- Verify plan preserves architectural patterns defined in PRD
- Validate against any architectural principles or design constraints in PRD

### Phase 5: Plan Structure Generation

**Create comprehensive plan with the following structure:**

Whats below here is a template for you to fill for the implementation agent:

```markdown
# Feature: <feature-name>

The following plan should be complete, but its important that you validate documentation and codebase patterns and task sanity before you start implementing.

Pay special attention to naming of existing utils types and models. Import from the right files etc.

## Feature Description

<Detailed description of the feature, its purpose, and value to users>

## User Story

## IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

Break the feature into discrete **Tasks**. Each Task is a logical unit of work that can be implemented and validated independently. Tasks are ordered by dependency — execute top to bottom.

### Task Format

Use information-dense keywords for clarity:

- **CREATE**: New files or components
- **UPDATE**: Modify existing files
- **ADD**: Insert new functionality into existing code
- **REMOVE**: Delete deprecated code
- **REFACTOR**: Restructure without changing behavior
- **MIRROR**: Copy pattern from elsewhere in codebase

### Task 1: <Short descriptive name>

<Describe what this task accomplishes and why it's needed>

- **IMPLEMENT**: {Specific implementation detail}
- **PATTERN**: {Reference to existing pattern - file:line}
- **IMPORTS**: {Required imports and dependencies}
- **GOTCHA**: {Known issues or constraints to avoid}
- **VALIDATE**: `{executable validation command}`

### Task 2: <Short descriptive name>

<Continue with all tasks in dependency order...>

### Task N: Testing & Validation

<Final task(s) should cover testing — unit tests, integration tests, edge cases, and validation against acceptance criteria>

---

## TESTING STRATEGY

<Define testing approach based on project's test framework and patterns discovered in during research>

### Unit Tests

<Scope and requirements based on project standards>

Design unit tests with fixtures and assertions following existing testing approaches

### Integration Tests

<Scope and requirements based on project standards>

### Edge Cases

<List specific edge cases that must be tested for this feature>

---

## VALIDATION COMMANDS

<Define validation commands based on project's tools discovered in Phase 2>

Execute every command to ensure zero regressions and 100% feature correctness.

### Level 1: Syntax & Style

```bash
# Lint (must pass with 0 errors)
uv run ruff check .

# Format check
uv run ruff format --check .
```

**Expected**: All commands pass with exit code 0

### Level 2: Unit Tests

<Project-specific unit test commands>

### Level 3: Integration Tests

<Project-specific integration test commands>

**Rationale**: <Why this approach fits this feature — reference task count, coupling, complexity, risk>

<!-- Include this section only if recommending Milestones -->
### Milestones

**Milestone 1: <Name>** (Tasks 1–3)
- <One-line summary of what this milestone achieves>
- **Validation checkpoint**: <What should be true before moving to the next milestone>

## NOTES

<Additional context, design decisions, trade-offs>
```

### Phase 6: Execution Strategy Recommendation

After generating all Tasks, review them holistically and recommend how the feature should be executed. Consider task dependencies, complexity, risk, and feedback loops.

**Evaluate three execution strategies:**

1. **Whole Feature** — Execute all tasks in a single pass. Recommend when:
   - Low complexity, few tasks (roughly 1–4)
   - Tasks are tightly coupled and hard to validate in isolation
   - Minimal risk of cascading failures

2. **Task by Task** — Execute and validate each task individually before proceeding. Recommend when:
   - Tasks are independent and each is independently testable
   - High complexity or uncertainty in individual tasks
   - Feature touches many unrelated parts of the codebase

3. **Milestones** — Group tasks into Milestones (logical checkpoints), execute one milestone at a time. Recommend when:
   - Feature has natural phases (e.g., data layer → service layer → API layer → tests)
   - Some tasks are tightly coupled within a group but loosely coupled across groups
   - Mid-to-high complexity where full single-pass is risky but task-by-task is unnecessarily granular

**Output the recommendation in this format:**

```markdown
## EXECUTION STRATEGY

**Recommended approach**: [Whole Feature / Task by Task / Milestones]

**Rationale**: <Why this approach fits this feature — reference task count, coupling, complexity, risk>

<!-- Include this section only if recommending Milestones -->
### Milestones

- <One-line summary>
- **Validation checkpoint**: <What should be true>

<Continue for all milestones...>
```
